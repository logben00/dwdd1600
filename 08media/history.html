            <dt><b>The Roots of Snowboarding</b></dt><dd>Snowboarding was created in 1965 when an engineer from Michigan named <em>Sherman Poppen </em>invented the prototype of a snowboard. (Of course, like many inventions, others claim they invented the first snowboard—more on this later.) Poppen’s initial prototype was a simple design: two skis that were cross-braced together.
                Rudimentary though it was, the original concept inspired others, like Dimitrije Milovich, to quickly evolve the initial snowboard’s design. In 1972, Milovich, who was a student at Cornell at the time and known for sliding down snowy hillsides on cafeteria trays, invented the winterstick. His original model, which was “a device made to surf the snow” looks very similar to the modern longboard.</dd>
            <dt><b>Snowboarding Throughout the '80s and '90s</b></dt><dd>The 1980s and 1990s are an important part of snowboarding history. Professional snowboarding events, which at the time consisted mostly of race and trick events, began in the early '80s leading to the formation of the International Snowboarding Federation (ISF) in 1985.
                Snowboards also started appearing in movies. The snowboarding scene in the James Bond movie, "A View to Kill" released in 1995 is a good example.
                In 1998, snowboarding made its debut at the Olympics with giant slalom and halfpipe events. The '90s were also when manufacturers began producing snowboards at a greater scale, which helped grow the sport immensely.</dd>
            <dt><b>Early 2000's to Present</b></dt><dd>America was the host nation for the 2002 Winter Olympics, which took place in <strong>Park City, Utah, </strong>and had a massive U.S. audience. At 29 hours of viewership per U.S. household, Americans watched more of the Winter Olympics, including snowboarding events, than any other nation in 2022. One of the most popular events at the Games was the snowboarding halfpipe event, which debuted in 1998. Ross Powers, Danny Kass, and Jarret Thomas (all Americans) took home the three medals for the event.
